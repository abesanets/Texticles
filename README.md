## 🔧 Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Text Rendering** - Text/emoji is drawn on an offscreen canvas
2. **Pixel Analysis** - Canvas pixel data is analyzed to create target positions
3. **Particle System** - Particles are generated and move toward target positions
4. **Physics Engine** - Real-time physics with velocity, acceleration, and smoothing
5. **Interaction Handling** - Mouse movements apply forces to nearby particles
6. **Rendering Loop** - Optimized 60 FPS render cycle with performance scaling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Smart Particle Limits** - Automatic scaling based on device capability
- **Efficient Rendering** - Canvas-based rendering with hardware acceleration
- **Debounced Resize** - Optimized window resize handling
- **Memory Management** - Efficient particle array management
- **Reduced Motion Support** - Respects user accessibility preferences

### Browser Support
- ✅ Chrome 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+
